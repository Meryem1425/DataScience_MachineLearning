    "The domain you must have remembered it because you are worked on under project **\"EDA for Car Price Prediction Model\"**. **Auto Scout** data which using for this project, scraped from the on-line car trading company in 2019, contains many features of 9 different car models. In this project, you will use the data sets prepared for algorithms as a result of the EDA project.\n",

    "While starting you should import the necessary modules and load the data given as pkl file. Also you'll need to do a few pre-processing before moving to modelling. After that you will implement ***Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest*** and ***XG Boost*** algorithms respectively. You can measure the success of your models with regression evaluation metrics as well as with cross validation method.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the better results, you should try to increase the success of your models by performing hyperparameter tuning. Determine feature importances for the model. You can set your model with the most important features for resource saving. You should try to apply this especially in Random Forest and XG Boost algorithms. Unlike the others, you will perform hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and XG Boost using the ***GridSearchCV*** method. \n",
